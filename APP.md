# 3Draft viewer: how to use it

The viewer is the human side of 3Draft: a person and an AI look at, and edit, the same scene. The engine is described in the [README](README.md); this page is only about the app.

```sh
npm run app     # http://localhost:5173/app/   (repo only, not in the npm package)
```

It is one file, `app/index.html`, plus a dependency-free static server (`app/serve.js`, localhost only). The same page is published as a Claude artifact, where the scene lives in a shared database. When the MCP server serves it, everything the AI builds appears live.

## The view

- **Starting view: WebGPU.** If WebGPU is unavailable, or the GPU device is lost, the app falls back to SVG by itself and says so in the footer (`G` or the `WebGPU` button switches by hand). SVG shows colour and transparency only; WebGPU also shows metal, roughness and emission. The **filmic look** (`C`) adds linear light, Fresnel and tone mapping, so highlights roll off softly and `lamp`-like materials glow; switch it off for the plain flat look.
- **The drawing fills the stage.** On a desktop it covers the whole area; on a phone it is a little larger than the short side.
- **Drag** rotates, **double click** resets the view, the arrow keys rotate too.
- **The cross** follows the pointer and lies on the surface under it. The cursor is always a cross. On a phone, with no mouse, it aims at the middle.
- **Footer:** yaw, pitch, fly speed, which code answers picking (`pick hexaw` = the WebAssembly kernel), object count, live link, and the face under the cross.

## Keys

| key | does |
| --- | --- |
| `w a s d r f` | fly: forward, left, back, right, up, down. Every press is a speed step; the opposite key slows down |
| `Space` | stop moving (all speeds to zero) |
| `T` | fly to the object under the cross. Over nothing, or when too close or inside a model: out to the nearest object |
| `/` | show only the object under the cross; again: the whole scene, and the camera flies back to where it was |
| `M` | place a prism on the surface under the cross, or shoot one into empty space |
| `V` | Spider bar: the first `V` remembers a surface point, the second joins the two with a thin prism. `V` over empty space forgets the first point |
| `X`, `Delete` | delete the object under the cross |
| `U`, `Backspace` | undo: placing, deleting, painting, booleans and moves, one step at a time |
| `P` | show / hide the material palette |
| `I` | pick material: the material of the face under the cross becomes the selected one |
| `Shift` + press | paint the face under the cross with the selected material (palette must be on) |
| `Shift` + double click | paint the whole object |
| `O` | boolean (see below) |
| `H` | move gizmo (see below) |
| `E` | edges and points on / off (also the `Edges` button) |
| `C` | filmic look on / off (also the `Filmic` button; on at the start, WebGPU view only) |
| `G`, `L` | SVG / WebGPU, turn the light |
| `?` | show / hide these shortcuts under the view (hidden at the start; also the `Keys` button) |

## Clear and example models

- **`Clear`** (footer) removes every object in the scene. It is one undo step: `U` brings them all back.
- **`+ Example…`** (the drop-down in the footer) adds a ready-made model to the scene: the house (the Blender import, 45 objects), the Cessna, the stone bridge or the table. It is placed beside what is already there, on its +x side, and the view frames everything. One `U` removes the whole example again. Examples are normal objects after that: paint, move, boolean and delete them like any other.

## Moving an object: the gizmo (`H`)

There is one gizmo at a time, and `H` cycles through three states:

1. **First `H`**: the gizmo appears on the object under the cross, on the world axes (x red, y green, z blue).
2. **Second `H`**: it turns to the object's own axes. Objects carry no transform, so these come from the shape: y stays up, x and z follow the turn around y that fits the footprint best (an object that already lines up with the world axes looks the same in both states).
3. **Third `H`**: the gizmo goes away.

Drag one of the arrows to slide the object along that axis; the arrow thickens under the pointer. While dragging only the picture changes; one write goes to the database when you let go, and one `U` takes the whole drag back.

## Boolean operations (`O`)

Press `O` over an object: it gets an orange box. Press `O` over another one (green box): a small question asks which operation to run.

| key | operation |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | union |
| `2` | A − B (A is the orange one) |
| `3` | B − A |
| `4` | intersect |
| `5`, `Esc` | cancel |

The result is a new object named like `A-B` and it replaces both operands; `U` brings the two originals back and removes the result. `O` over empty space forgets a marked object.

The math is the engine's `boolean(a, b, op)` (README, part 1). Both objects must be **closed solids with outward faces**. An open shell, such as a wall without thickness, is refused with the reason in the dialog. With messy data (coincident faces) the result can come out open; the engine's `validate` says so.

## Materials (`P`)

Twelve starting materials: plaster, sand, wood, dark wood, concrete, slate, grass, brick, steel, gold, glass, lamp. Pick one, then `Shift`+press to paint a face or `Shift`+double click for the whole object.

**Pick material (`I`, or the `pick` button):** the eyedropper. `I` takes the material of the face under the cross. The `pick` button arms it, and the next click on a surface takes it (`Esc` cancels). The palette opens and that material is selected, so you can read its sliders or paint with it right away. A face that has only a colour selects the material with that colour, or starts a new material from it.

For the selected material there are four sliders (`metal`, `rough`, `alpha`, `emit`, 0 to 5) and a colour; `+ new` copies it as a new material. A painted face stores the material **name**, so editing a material changes every face made of it.

## Isolating, travelling

`/` hides everything but the object under the cross and frames it. The camera pose from before is remembered and restored when you leave. `T` flies the camera to the object under the cross (nothing under it: out to the nearest object, which also gets you out of a model you are inside).

## Phone

Four round buttons cover the main actions: travel, place, delete, and the view mode. Drag rotates; the cross aims at the middle of the screen.

## One object model and the database

Objects that come from outside (the database, the MCP server) and objects made in the app are the same thing: `{ id, name, mesh }`. Painting, deleting, isolating, booleans, moving and undo work on all of them, whoever made them. With the artifact database every change is written back, so the AI sees what the person did.

Collections:

- `objects`: one document per object, `{ name, mesh }`, at most 256 KiB each.
- `palette`: one document per material, `{ color, metal, rough, alpha, emit, order }`.

Undo is a per-session stack in the page; it does not reach back past a reload.
